# Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka, Flink, Elasticsearch, and TMDB API

> **Basma El Baali**

### Overview:
This project sets up a real-time data streaming pipeline designed to process, store, and visualize movie-related data. The system utilizes a combination of powerful tools:
- **Kafka** for handling real-time, data streams.
- **Flink** for performing data processing in real-time, enabling insights and analytics.
- **Elasticsearch** for indexing and querying large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Kibana** for visualizing the processed data through intuitive dashboards.
- **TMDB API** to fetch movie-related data like movie details, ratings, and reviews.

The goal is to create an efficient pipeline that ingests real-time movie data, processes it, and displays visual analytics using Elasticsearch and Kibana. You can customize and extend this setup with additional tools, but ensure compatibility among all the components.

This guide outlines the steps to implement and work with this pipeline, including the integration of the **TMDB API** for retrieving movie data. Feel free to modify or extend this setup to fit your project requirements, but be sure to ensure compatibility across tools and technologies.

## Project Part 1

### **`TMDB`** API

- **How to Get Your TMDB API Key:**

    To access data from the TMDB (The Movie Database) API, you need an API key. Hereâ€™s how you can get one:

    1. **Sign Up for an Account**: Go to the [TMDB website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create an account.
    2. **Generate an API Key**: Once logged in, go to the **API** section under your account settings:  
       [TMDB API Section](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
    3. **Create a New API Key**: Follow the instructions to create an API key. Once created, you'll receive a unique API key that you can use to make requests to the TMDB API.

    ```bash
    "YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY"
    ```

    Replace `"YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY"` with the key you obtained from TMDB.

- **API Request Example**:  
    Once you have the API key, you can make requests to fetch data. For instance, to get details of a specific movie, you can use the following request:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY"
    ```

    Replace `"550"` with the desired movie ID (e.g., ID for "Fight Club").

- **Kafka Info**:
    - **Start Zookeeper**:  
    Kafka uses Zookeeper for distributed coordination. Start Zookeeper by running the following command from the Kafka directory:

        ```bash
        bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
        ```
        
    - **Start Kafka Server**:  
    Open a new terminal and start the Kafka server with the following command:

        ```bash
        bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
        ```

    - **Create a Topic**:  
    To create a Kafka topic named "tmdb_movies", run the following command:

        ```bash
        bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic tmdb_movies --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
        ```

    - **List Topics**:  
    To list all existing topics, run:

        ```bash
        bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
        ```

    - **Produce Messages**:  
    Use the following command to produce messages to the "**tmdb_movies**" topic:

        ```bash
        bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic tmdb_movies --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
        ```

    - **Consume Messages**:  
    Open a new terminal and run the following command to consume messages from the "tmdb_movies" topic:

        ```bash
        bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic tmdb_movies --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning
        ```

- **Server Properties**:
    - **Default Configuration**:

        ```python
        # Listener name, hostname, and port the broker will advertise to clients.
        # If not set, it uses the value for "listeners".
        advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
        ```

- ***My Kafka Info***:  
    After starting Zookeeper & Kafka, run the following commands:

        ```bash
        bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
        bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
        ```

    You should see the following output in the Kafka terminal:

        ```bash
        [2023-12-03 17:11:15,535] INFO Registered broker 0 at path /brokers/ids/0 with addresses: PLAINTEXT://PNS-VirtualBox:9092, czxid (broker epoch): 124 (kafka.zk.KafkaZkClient)
        
        default topic: 'tmdb_movies'
        bootstrap-server: 'PNS-VirtualBox:9092'
        ```
